The Vesuvius Challenge and our community [made history](grandprize) by reading inside a Herculaneum scroll without opening it.
Now, our goal is to go from reading 5% of a scroll to 90% of four scrolls.
We need your help!

You can play a key role in our mission to read the lost library of the Herculaneum scrolls.
Take a look at [our story](/#our-story), what we've accomplished, and what prizes we are offering now.

### Current state

In 2023 we awarded more than [$1,000,000](winners) across 53 prizes, resulting in the historic breakthrough of reading the inside of a Herculaneum scroll.
As a part of Stage 2, we have now announced a 2024 Grand Prize, as well as another series of progress prizes, to help us get from 5% to 90% of the scroll.
Read more about the [current prizes here](2024_prizes)!
