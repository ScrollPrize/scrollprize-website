**You** can make history, win prizes, and help read the lost library of the Herculaneum scrolls. Here's how:

### 1. Join the community

### 2. See a scroll

Get a feel for [the data](data) by looking inside a scroll that has not been opened in 2,000 years:
* [In your browser](https://dl.ash2txt.org/view/Scroll1)
* [In 1-2 lines of Python](https://github.com/ScrollPrize/vesuvius) (or [in C](https://github.com/ScrollPrize/vesuvius-c)!)

### 3. Dive in

Our goal is to read 90% of each of four scrolls:
